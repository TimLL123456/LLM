# LLM Booking System

## Overview
The LLM Booking System is a comprehensive booking platform that includes two user interfaces: a traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Language Model-based User Interface (LLM BUI). This system allows users to make bookings and receive recommendations for available times when their preferred slots are occupied. The LLM BUI enhances user experience by enabling natural language interactions for completing bookings.
